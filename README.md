## Finding the square root

This Python program uses Newton's Method of Successive Approximations to find the square root of any number.  
The user is asked to give a positive number and guess what the square root of the number is.  Based off of the user's guess, the program uses Newton's Method to run a loop that eventually finds a very accurate square root of the positive number.
